<h2>Dataset Information:</h2>

1. <b>Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy </b>
2. <b>Time: time in format hh:mm:ss </b>
3. <b>Global_active_power: household global mi|nute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) </b>
    * Global active power is a term used in electrical engineering to<br> refer to the total active power consumption of a building or an entire electrical<br> grid. It is a measure of the real power used by electrical devices and is expressed in watts (W).<br><br>
4. <b>Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) </b>
    * Global reactive power is a term used in electrical engineering to refer to the<br> total reactive power consumption of a building or an entire electrical grid.<br> It is a measure of the amount of electrical power that is flowing back and forth between<br> the source and the load in an alternating current (AC) electrical system, and it doesn't do any <br>useful work, but it is necessary to maintain the voltage level in the system. It is expressed in volt-amperes reactive (VAR).<br><br>
5. <b>Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) </b>
    * Voltage, also known as electric potential difference, is a <br>measure of the electrical potential energy per unit charge in an electrical circuit. It is the force that drives<br> the flow of electric charge in a circuit, and is expressed in volts (V).<br><br>
6. <b>Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) </b>
    * Global intensity refers to the overall or average current flow <br>in an electrical system or network, such as a building or an entire electrical grid. It is a measure of the <br>amount of electric charge moving through a conductor per unit of time and is expressed in amperes (A).<br><br>
7. <b>Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). </b>
    * It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher,<br> an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).<br><br>
8. <b>Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). </b>
    * It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine,<br> a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.<br><br>
9. <b>Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). </b>
    * It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.<br><br>
